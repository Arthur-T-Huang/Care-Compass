Phase II of the project proved to be more complex than the previous phase last week. This was particularly due to the project moving from a conceptual model to tweaking upon review of the feasibility of our ideas. For this phase, I worked on developing the CareCompass data model wherein for each of the user personas – Gale, a student studying Global Health; Nancy, a policymaker; and Archibald, an individual relocating abroad – a local data model was created to attend to their respective archetype’s needs. Further, I integrated the three local data models into one global data model. I then took the global data model and designed a relational database map based on the relationships I found for our application. Finally, I summarized the relational map and global data model in an initial SQL DDL. This work may be seen here: . I additionally created several more UI wireframes, particularly for Archibald and one screen for each of Gale and Nancy. 

Aside from the project work of the past week, I have continued to explore around Belgium! I have enjoyed learning how to decorate chocolate from a pastry chef of the oldest bakery in Belgium, shopping around Namur, and getting to know some KU Leuven students studying nearby. I look forward to my future adventures, especially as our program travels to Luxembourg this coming week.
