### Project
For Phase III, my main focus shifted from design and modeling to implementation. I was responsible for building out most of our backend REST API, starting with the country routes. I implemented endpoints that allow users to retrieve detailed country profiles, list all countries (with optional score filtering), and fetch factor scores by country ID. I also added admin-only functionality for updating and deleting country records, which gives us full CRUD support. 

Beyond country routes, I worked on the recommendations and comparison endpoints. I built the /recommendations/factors route to return the six health system dimensions we use across the app, each with a description to help users understand what they're prioritizing.
