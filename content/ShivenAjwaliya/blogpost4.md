### Project
In Phase IV, my primary focus was polishing and finalizing core functionalities across both the frontend and backend. I took the lead on developing the Rankings page, designing the logic to dynamically rank countries based on healthcare factor scores and allowing users to adjust weights via interactive sliders. I also added contextual descriptions for each factor to improve user understanding.

On the backend, I created the CountryArticles table, filled it with mock data using Mockaroo, and integrated the results into each country profile to provide students and relocating residents with relevant, more in-depth reading recommendations.

Additionally, I wrote our entire project’s README, detailing everything from the project overview and goals to the repo structure, tech stack, data sources, and run instructions. I also included thoughtful future plans—like using quality-of-life datasets for a more nuanced recommendation engine.

To wrap up development, I cleaned up our codebase by removing unused routes and refining our REST API matrix to reflect the final architecture accurately. This phase was about precision, polish, and making sure the entire app was coherent and ready to present.
