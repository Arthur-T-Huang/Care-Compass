# Project Updates
We began this phase by revisiting and refining our user archetypes, making each persona more specific and realistic. We added names, contextual details, and motivations that better aligned with the updated features of our app. For example, our original traveler persona was reframed as Archibald Bridgemont, a parent relocating to Europe with his family, a change that made more sense for features like personalized healthcare system matching. Similarly, Nancy the policymaker was rewritten to focus less on a single country and more on globally informed, evidence-based reform, reflecting our systemâ€™s international comparison and forecasting capabilities. Gale, the student, was also given more context and academic grounding, reinforcing his need for tools like time-series charts and visual comparisons.

These refined personas helped us anchor our technical decisions to real, use-driven goals. Updates to the full set of personas can be viewed in our [Phase I blog post](https://arthur-t-huang.github.io/Care-Compass-Blog/team_posts/phase1post/)

We also went back and articulated our data sources better, and found a new, more comprehensive data set as well, that changed some of the technicalities we wanted in our inital plan. Due to this, we also changed those concepts to match our new vision in our first blog post. 

This shift in data informed several important technical updates. Most notably, we moved away from our original idea of allowing users to assign custom weights to healthcare factors and instead implemented a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model to generate personalized country recommendations based on user priorities. We also introduced a time series forecasting model that enables users to view historical trends and predict future values for key healthcare indicators.

Together, these updates helped us move from a loosely scoped concept to a more concrete, implementable system with clearly defined features tied directly to our personas.

# Data Sources:
At the end of Phase I, we had gathered data from two datasets, households impoverished by out of pocket payments, and general practitioners per 10,000 population. For Phase II, in addition to cleaning and visualizing these two datasets, we have also gathered, cleaned, and graphed out data from 9 new datasets, as updated in our [blog post for phase 1](https://arthur-t-huang.github.io/Care-Compass-Blog/team_posts/phase1post/#data-sources). 8 of these new datasets were pulled from the World Health Organization API, the other dataset web scraped from the Global Health Security Index, to give us that overall score we were looking for. For each of the World of Health datasets, the gatherer information was fitted into a dataframe which had distinct country and date columns, since every W.H.O dataset contained these two values. Additionally, the Global Health Index dataset contained 300+ columns of factors which were used to help calculate the overall score for a country (ex. Antimicrobial resistance, Access to potable water, etc). Some of these factors were then visualized in comparison to the the overall score of a country, and we plan on including factors with high correlation to overall score to the slider feature mentioned in the [blog post for phase 1](https://arthur-t-huang.github.io/Care-Compass-Blog/team_posts/phase1post/#data-sources).
We have visualized a couple of the datasets in different ways as they relate to the wireframes that we plan to implement:

# ER Diagrams:
Below are localized ER diagrams for each personna: the green diagram corresponding to the mover Archibald, red diagram corresponding to the student Gale, and the blue diagram corresponding to the policymaker Nancy.

Further, the global ER model is seen here:

Based on our global data model, a first pass of our SQL DDL can be seen below.
