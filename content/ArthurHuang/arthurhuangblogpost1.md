For the first phase of the deliverable, in class, I had learned lots regarding api get requests, as well as how to clean data, sort the data into a dataframe, and graph the corresponding data using plotly. Through working on the homework, I also became more familiar with datetime and time objects, as well as how to convert between the two while accounting for factors such as time zone differences, as well as defaulting years (1900). Additionally during our trips to NATO, the EU Parliament, and the EU Commision, it was fascinating to learn about how each organization was structured, as well as seeing the differences between how representatives from each group presented and answered our questions. On a more leisurely note, I had lots of fun learning how to decorate pastries with Dr. Fontenotâ€™s friend in Belgium, as well as learning about the history behind the cathedral, concert hall, and market square of Bruges over the weekend.
